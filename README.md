# mixers

## Project Summary
Privacy engineering-focused code implementation and analysis of basic transaction and ledger mixer using a fictional payments product. 

First, code will feature a basic OOD payments product with a centralized ledger of transactions, ability for payers to send payments to each other in a P2P and record payments on the ledger, and have all the connections occur over a network (localhost, for now).

A privacy engineering-focused analysis of the product, in that current state, will occur drawing on lierature in the field by Solove, Warren/Brandeis, Bambauer, Maxwell, Chaum, Dennedy/Fox/Finneran, and NIST. 

A mixer focus on blending payments input/output between of group of payers will be implemented in code, and a mixer focus on blending records on the ledger will be implemented. 

Then, the same priv eng analysis will occur.
